#### Authros: Elene Zuroshvili, Hamza Dhich, Nurbek Bektursyn, Matyas Kovacs

Welcome to the second term project for the ECBS 5146 course, *SQL and Different Shapes of Data*. This project is designed to synthesize and apply the concepts learned during the course by creating a data product suitable for analysis. The goal is to combine datasets, enrich them, and build a complete data pipeline, demonstrating our technical skills and creativity.  

The repository contains the following artifacts:
1. MySQL World Database 
2. total-government-expenditure-on-education-gdp.csv
3. Knime workflow
4. Final report
5. PowerPoint Presentation

Steps to follow to achieve a reproducible result:

1. Download the SQL dump file and run it in your MySQL workbench.
2. Next, you need to manually adjust the specified node in the Knime workflow to reflect your local MySQL serverâ€™s username and password accurately.
3. download the CSV file to your local machine and import it into the second Knime node.
5. After that, all nodes should run smoothly until the visualization part.
6. For the visualizations, download the extension and put it into your Knime workflow: [Choropleth Map](https://hub.knime.com/knime/spaces/Examples/00_Components/Visualizations/Choropleth%20Map~L8IzuxeVxBOw4qDm/current-state).
