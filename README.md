Welcome to the second term project for the ECBS 5146 course, *SQL and Different Shapes of Data*. This project is designed to synthesize and apply the concepts learned during the course by creating a data product suitable for analysis. The goal is to combine datasets, enrich them, and build a complete data pipeline, demonstrating our technical skills and creativity.  

The repository contains following artifacts:
1. MySQL World Database 
2. total-government-expenditure-on-education-gdp.csv
3. Knime worflow
4. Final report
5. PowerPoint Presentation

Steps to follow to achieve a reproducable result:

1. download the sql dump file and run it in your MySQL workbench

3. download the csv file to your local machine and import it into the second knime node
5. after that all of the nodes should run smoothly until the visualization part
6. for the visualizations download the extension : nurbek adds stuff here:
